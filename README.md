Problem Statement 1:
Implementation of Bipartite Max Cover
Technique : Greedy Algorithm
Time complexity :
For a bipartite graph G â€“ Time complexity is  O(mn^2), where n is the number of elements in the second set and m is the number of edges in the first set.


Problem Statement 2:
Implementation of Matrix Chain Multiplication 
Technique :Dynamic Programming
Time complexity :
O(N^3) where N is the number present in the chain of the matrices. As we know that we use a matrix of N*N order to find the minimum operations. 
We need to find the minimum value for all the k values where i<=k<j. So overall we use 3 nested for loop.
